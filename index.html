    <h1>Web Design and Creation</h1>
    <h3>What will you do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make websites (like this one!) and host them online</li>
        <li>Learn to make pretty web designs (or ugly ones!)</li>
        <li>Learn how the internet works</li>
        <li>Use online and offline computer coding tools</li>
        <li>Learn the basics of javascript to make web-based animations and games

            <div id="animation" class="backdrop">
                <h5>This is an animation.</h5>
                <div id="ball" class="ball"></div>
            </div>

            <div id="game" class="backdrop">
                <h5 id="instructions">This is a game. Click anywhere to start, then try to click the magically appearing
                    circle. Miss, you lose a point. Click you get a point. The circles will get faster! 10 circles
                    total!</h5>
                <div id="circle" class="ball"></div>

    <h3>What do you need to know?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This course has no prerequisites. Come one, come all!</li>
        <li>This course will focus primarily on coding for <em>design</em> and <em>content</em>. If you care less about
            designing and more about problem-solving, consider the Computer Programming Principles course instead or in
            addition!</li>
